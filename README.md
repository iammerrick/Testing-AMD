# Testing-AMD

This is not a library that demonstrates testing AMD. Well, it does but its designed to show the current pain points of testing AMD so we can create better solutions moving forward.

## Structure

Just opening tests.html should run the tests. There is a test file for each app file. And occasionally a markdown document to better articulate the pain points.
